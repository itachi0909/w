Program 1: write a prolog in prolog calculate addition of two number.
Code : sum(X,Y):S is X+Y,
write('Sum is: '),write(S).
output:

Program 2: write a prolog in prolog to find maximum of two number.
Code: max(X,Y):X=Y,
write('both are equal')
;
X>Y,
Z is X,
write(Z)
;
Z is Y,
write(Z).
output:

Program 3: write a prolog in prolog that take number N from the user and count from N to
10.
Code : count(11).
count(N):write(N),nl,
X is N+1,
count(X).
output:

Program 4: write a prolog in prolog that take number N from the user and count from N to 1.
Code: loop(0).
loop(N):-N>0,
write(N),nl,
X is N-1,
loop(X).
output:

Program 5: write a prolog in prolog that take number N from the user calculate factorial of
number.
Code: factorial(0, 1).
factorial(N, X) :N > 0,
Y is N - 1,
factorial(Y, Z),
X is Z * N.
Output:

Program 6: write a prolog in prolog that take number N from the user calculate square of
number from N to 20 and display it.
Code: squares(21).
squares(N) :Y is N * N,
write(Y), nl,
M is N + 1,
squares(M).
output:
